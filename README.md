# DataTable_WithColumHeaderfilter
Datatable with column header filter along with sorting button


by default 
---------------------------------------
column headers which is already attached to a sorting button
if created a additional input element even with its click 
sorting will occur instead of desired output.


Here in the working example i have added a column header in which 
i am stopping the propagation on keycode 13 enter keypress and click event

and filtering and sorting is already done with the help of jquery Data table plugin.
